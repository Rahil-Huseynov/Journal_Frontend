    "intro": "Authors are informed that each submitted article goes through several stages. If the editorial board finds the article scientifically insignificant at the initial screening, the author is notified promptly. If the topic is of interest, two expert reviewers are appointed for double‑blind evaluation. The author’s status, affiliation and other personal data are not considered during review; the process usually takes <strong>2‑3 months</strong>. After a thorough analysis, comments and the decision are sent to the authors.",
